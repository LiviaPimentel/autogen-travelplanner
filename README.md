# A Travel Planner powered by AutoGen Agents

## üåü Motivation

Planning a trip can be overwhelming, especially when you're unfamiliar with the destination. With endless options for activities, dining, and sightseeing, it's challenging to know where to start. 

## Purpose

This Streamlit app leverages the power of AutoGen agents to provide a curated travel guide with personalized recommendations for hotels, airports, must-see places, and dining options.

### Why is this important?

- Travellers spend over 5 hours on average with travel content in the 45 days prior to booking (source: [Expedia Group Research, July 2023 ](https://www.expediagroup.com/investors/news-and-events/financial-releases/news/news-details/2023/TRAVELERS-SPEND-OVER-5-HOURS-RESEARCHING-TRIPS-ON-AVERAGE---LONGER-THAN-FLYING-FROM-LOS-ANGELES-TO-WASHINGTON-DC---ACCORDING-TO-EXPEDIA-GROUP-RESEARCH/default.aspx#:~:text=July%2025%2C%202023%2C%20SEATTLE%20%E2%80%94,45%20days%20prior%20to%20booking.)).

- Overall, 22% of U.S. adults find that creating their trip itinerary is one of the most frustrating parts of planning and booking a trip, and almost 40% of Gen Z believe less time dedicated to planning and booking would enable them to get into vacation-mode feeling energized, rather than starting their trip exhausted.  (source: [Priceline Press Center, Feb 2024 ](https://press.priceline.com/new-priceline-research-finds-average-traveler-spends-two-full-work-days-to-plan-and-book-trips/))

In this scenario, the impact intended with such an app comes from:

- **Time-saving**: eliminating the hours spent researching and organizing activities by providing a curated list of suggestions.
- **Personalization**: adapting the suggestions based on the user's specific information, ensuring a unique experience.
- **Discovery**: suggesting hidden gems and must-see attractions.
- **Optimization**: ensure you make the most out of your trip without feeling rushed.
